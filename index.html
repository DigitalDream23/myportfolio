            From conceptual innovation to branding and communication, I have 
            explored a bit of most things. Change and change often; that's my modo.

            <h3>Improving efficiency through data sourcing</h3>
            <p id="autonomusinfo">This Project was developed under the premise that in a few years time, 
                every major car company is going to have autonomus driving technology and that
            the main source of profit will be an autonomus car sharing membership. The key 
            will be how to administer that fleet in the most efficient way possible.
            To this end, the seemingly unrelated calendar app was completly overhauled to a
            web based service for both consumers an businesses to handle all schedules and
            gather data to aticipate the needs for logistics and transportation.</p>

            <p id="veganinfo">In this project, I created a communication campaign for a ‘MOLE’, a company that develops vegan
                 foods. The objective of the campaign is to shift the negative perception the majority of society
                  has of veganism, into an aspirational and desirable. And in the process, undo years of poor,
                   aggressive and antagonizing communication from activist groups and sentiment forming lobbying
                    from interest groups such as the meat and dairy industries.

                 with a dash of comedy to it.</p>

            <p id="masetainfo">Looking to find a solution for the problem of certain materials I developed for this project a “sintered recycled
                 rubber” material sourced mainly from old tiers.
                The main thesis for the project was that the discarded tiers where a wasted opportunity but also that this new material,
                 though recycled from waste, afforded certain new esthetical qualities that could be applied to a wide range of high end
                  products, where this material had never been used before.

                 of people needs to be relocated with urgency. It consist of a collection of interconnected inflatable structures that
                  are filled with expandable bio-plastics, which later become rigid structures in 24 hours.

            <p id="CMYKinfo">CMYK is a simple conceptual product developed for Ikea. The objective of the design was to create a bench
                 in keeping with the brands ethos in terms of design, materials, etc. but with a layout that allowed for
                  the packaging to be a product on itself. The packaging showcases the product in such a way that it becomes
                   a desirable product on its own while, at the same time, reducing costs and materials used in traditional packaging.

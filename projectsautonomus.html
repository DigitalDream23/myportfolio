        <h1>Autonomus Car Fleet Administration Efficiency</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p>This Project was developed under the premise that in a few years time, 
            every major car company is going to have autonomus driving technology and that
        the main source of profit will be an autonomus car sharing membership. The key 
        will be how to administer that fleet in the most efficient way possible</p>

    <p>To this end, the seemingly unrelated calendar app was completly overhauled to a
        web based service for both consumers an businesses, capable of handling all
        sorts of tasks related to shceduling. Most of the interactions between consumers
        and businesses related to shceduling being carried out through the interface, reducing
        the time required and making the whole proccess more efficient.
        At the same time all of these interactions between consumers and businesses create
        in the proccess a lot of data that can be fed into an algorithm to better administer
         the logistics behind an autonomus fleet, allowing it to predict the require changes
         and movements ahead of time.
